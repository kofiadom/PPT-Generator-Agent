### Layout Compatibility Notes

**Slide 0 (Title):**

**Slide 6 (Dual Trends):**
- Best for: Two-item comparisons, before/after, pros/cons
- Avoid: More than two items (layout will feel cramped)

**Slide 7 (Data + Findings):**
- Best for: Quantitative analysis with interpretation
- Avoid: Raw data without context

**Slide 8 (Four-Box Grid):**
- Best for: 4 equal items, service offerings, deliverables

### Best Practices

1. **Maintain Consistency:** Use the same slide type for similar content throughout presentation
2. **Visual Flow:** Alternate between dense (Slides 2, 6, 7) and light (Slides 3, 4) slides
3. **Section Markers:** Use Slide 4 format between major sections
4. **Data Storytelling:** Follow Slide 7 (data) with Slide 8 or 9 (implications/action)
5. **Strong Close:** Consider using Slide 10 (team) near end to build credibility before final ask
