Proposal Title: Enterprise Payroll Transformation

Client / Organization: Acme Manufacturing Ltd.

Prepared by: Papaya Global Consulting – Transformation Services

Prepared for: Dana Morales, VP People Operations

Version: v1.0

Deck Date: November 2, 2025

# 2) Overview / Executive Summary

Acme Manufacturing operates across 12 countries with fragmented payroll, inconsistent compliance, and limited real-time visibility. This proposal consolidates payroll onto a single global platform with standardized processes, automated controls, and executive-ready analytics.

Top Messages:

* Consolidate 12-country payroll onto one global solution to lift accuracy, speed, and compliance.
* Automate validations and integrations with ERP (NetSuite) and HCM (Workday) to cut manual touchpoints by >60%.
* Deliver a 6‑month phased deployment with measured outcomes and rigorous change management.
* Expected ROI within 12 months via error reduction, avoided penalties, and lower cost per payslip.
* Executive dashboards provide real-time payroll performance and compliance posture.

Business context / background: Acme’s growth by acquisition created a patchwork of in‑country providers and spreadsheets. Finance and HR spend significant time reconciling variances and handling employee tickets.

Current state summary (pain points): 7‑day close, 96.2% accuracy, 480 monthly payroll tickets, limited audit trail, and 6 compliance incidents in the past 12 months.

Vision / desired future state: A unified global payroll with 99.8% accuracy, 2‑day close, zero preventable compliance incidents, and self‑service visibility for employees and managers.

Success criteria: Accuracy ≥ 99.8%, on‑time payroll ≥ 99.9%, close time ≤ 2 business days, payroll ticket volume reduced by ≥ 75%, zero regulator findings in audits.

Risks / constraints: Historic data quality, country‑specific legal nuances, change fatigue in plants, and dependency on timely ERP/HCM integration support.

# 3) Understanding the Problem

## Item 1: Fragmented Providers & Processes

Problem statement: Multiple in‑country vendors with divergent calendars and file formats.

Evidence / data points: 12 providers, 7 file templates, 14 manual handoffs; 2 missed tax filings in FY2025.

Business impact: High rework, penalty risk, poor employee experience.

Priority: High

Owner / SME: Payroll Ops Lead – Jamie Chen

## Item 2: Manual Data Prep & Controls

Problem statement: Time‑intensive spreadsheets for pre‑pay validation and retro calculations.

Evidence / data points: Average 22 hours per cycle on manual checks; 3% variance caught post‑pay.

Business impact: Delayed close; inconsistent audit trail.

Priority: High

Owner / SME: Finance Shared Services – Martin Silva

## Item 3: Limited Visibility & Analytics

Problem statement: No unified dashboards; leadership relies on ad‑hoc reports.

Evidence / data points: CFO receives consolidated payroll KPIs 10 days after month‑end.

Business impact: Slow decisions; hard to forecast cash and accruals.

Priority: Medium

Owner / SME: People Analytics – Priya Shah

Project Objective (SMART): By June 30, 2026, standardize and automate Acme’s payroll across 12 countries to achieve 99.8% accuracy, a ≤2‑day close, a ≥75% reduction in ticket volume, and an 18% decrease in cost per payslip, sustained for three consecutive cycles.
